Changes in version 0.27:

Maintenance release.

A GCC warning about catching std::bad_alloc by value has been fixed.
(Thanks to Mohammad Akhlaghi).

Errors are now also checked when closing the input file.

The configure script now accepts appending options to CXXFLAGS using the
syntax 'CXXFLAGS+=OPTIONS'.
